										<p>
											In this study we developed an automatic method to predict tumour volume and shape in week 3 and 4 of RT, using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans acquired up to week 2, allowing identification
											of large tumour changes. 240 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, treated with 55Gy in 20 fractions, were collected. CBCTs were rigidly registered to the planning CT. Intensity values were extracted 
											in each voxel of the planning target volume across all CBCT images from days 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14. For each patient and in each voxel, four regression models were fitted to voxel intensity; applying linear, Gaussian,
											quadratic and cubic methods. These models predicted the intensity value for each voxel in weeks 3 and 4, and the tumour volume found by thresholding. Each model was evaluated by computing the root mean square error (RMSE) in pixel value and structural similarity index metric (SSIM) for all patients. 
											Finally, the sensitivity and specificity to predict 30% change in volume were calculated for each model. The linear, Gaussian, quadratic and cubic models achieved a comparable similarity score, the average SSIM for all patients was 0.94, 0.94, 0.90, 0.83 in week 3, respectively.
											At week 3, a sensitivity of 84%, 53%, 90% and 88%, and specificity of 99%, 100%, 91% and 42% were observed for the linear, Gaussian, quadratic and cubic models respectively. Overall, the linear model performed best at predicting those patients that will benefit from RT adaptation. 
											The linear model identified 21% and 23% of patients in our cohort with more than 30% tumour volume reduction to benefit from treatment adaptation in week 3 and 4 respectively. We have shown that it is feasible to predict the shape and volume of NSCLC tumours from routine CBCTs and effectively identify patients who will respond to treatment early.

										<p>
											In this study, we propose a novel approach to investigate changes in the visible tumour and surrounding tissues with the aim of distinguishing modes of tumour change (elastic versus non-elastic) without segmentation on the follow-up images.
											On-treatment cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of 240 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received 55 Gy of radiotherapy were included. CBCTs were aligned onto planning computed tomography (planning CT) scan using a 
											two-step rigid registration process. To explore density changes across the lung-tumour boundary, eight shells confined to the shape of the gross tumour volume (GTV) were created. The shells extended 6 mm inside and outside of the GTV border, 
											and each shell is 1.5 mm thick. After applying intensity correction on CBCTs, the mean intensity was extracted from each shell across all CBCTs. Thereafter, linear fits were created, indicating density change over time in each shell during treatment.
											The slopes of all eight shells were clustered to explore patterns in the slopes that show how tumours change. Seven clusters were obtained, 97% of the patients were clustered into three groups. After visual inspection, we found that these clusters 
											represented patients with little or no density change, progression and regression. For the three groups, the survival curves were not significantly different between the groups, p-value=0.51. However, the results show that definite patterns of tumour changes exist,
											suggesting that it may be possible to identify modes of tumour changes from on-treatment CBCT images.

										<p>
											Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and IoT have undoubtedly been the largest shapers of the 21st century, changing how people live, think and work. Though, many in the developed world and a few privileged in the developing world can attest to this. Due to illiteracy,
											socio-economic constraints and unavailability of many non-western languages especially African languages on these mobile devices; majority of the people in developing countries are yet to benefit from these mobile devices. Yet, the rise of powerful artificial intelligence and natural language processing
											present new opportunities for many users of mobile devices to easily interact with their devices in their own vernacular language. Thus, get the best out of their devices.
											This paper presents results collected through an online survey across 6 African countries to establish what African users think of existing voice assistants, such as Siri, Google assistant and alike. Additionally, provides recommendations based on our findings that will improve these voice assistants to 
											better understand what Africans say. Therefore, improve the user experience of African users.

										<p>
											Promising a world of endless opportunities, open data is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon, attracting interests from many governments, such as the United States of America, Germany, United Kingdom, Canada and Kenya to mention a few. 
											Furthermore, institutions such as the United Nations, World Bank and the African Development Bank. Seeking ways to harness value from open data, these countries and institutions have established open data portals to serve as technical enablers,
											easing access to public data and acting as one-stop shop for a wide variety of data ranging from environment, education, health, transportation, geo-location, budget, weather, consumer products and consumer finance. These portals do not only enable
											citizens to access a wide variety of datasets but through APIs allow citizens to transform the data into innovative applications or solutions that solve local challenges and societal problems, thus, improve quality of life for citizens. Sequel to the 
											possibilities that surrounds open data portal, it will be helpful to have an open data portal in Namibia. Consequently, to bridge the gap between the citizens, data and information, an open data portal becomes necessary. In this paper we provide practical, 
											yet technical insights on how an open data portal we developed will ease access to information and facilitate the development of innovative solutions that will aid communities in solving societal problems in Namibia.

										<p>
											Today, cities across the world are faced with numerous challenges, which put a lot of pressure on city resources. Hence, the need for cities to address challenges they are facing in a smart, efficient and effective manner. Technological advancements
											present vast opportunities to shape up how cities are managed and deliver public services. The notion of smart city has emerged as a key strategy to mitigate issues such as waste management, traffic congestions, air pollution, and to anticipate future challenges.
											Europe is leading the smart city revolution with at least one smart city in every one of the 28 European Union countries. However, in this age of massive urbanization, other cities are increasingly following this path, adopting scalable and solutions that leverage
											on the power of open data and ICT to deliver better services, increase quality of life and meet the aspirations of citizens. Today, Windhoek is faced with challenge of massive urban migration and its population is anticipated to grow above half a million mark by 2030.
											This paper demonstrates how open data can be visualised into applications that connect citizens to the city public transportation to enhance service delivery. Thus, making public services easily accessible, more efficient and effective.
