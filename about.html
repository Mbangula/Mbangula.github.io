									<h2> Dr Lameck Mbangula Amugongo </h2>
									<p> PhD in Cancer Science (Quantitative Image Analysis), software developer & Tech enthusiast   </p>
								</header>
                                <a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/devC.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>
									I completed my PhD in Cancer Science in the Radiotherapy related research (RRR) group at the University of Manchester (2021), 
									under the supervision of Dr Eliana Vasquez Osorio, Dr Andrew Green, Dr David Cobben, Prof Marcel van Herk and Dr Alan McWilliam.
									My PhD was sponsored through the <a href="https://www.darabigdata.com/lameck-amugongo" target="_blank">DARA Big Data project</a>, part of the Newton Fund and funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council,
									part of UKRI, and the South African Department of Science and Innovation. that provides students from the AVN countries with skills in the field
									of data science. 
									The DARA Big Data project provides intensive data science skills training to students from the 8 African
									countries who partnered to build the mid-frequency instrument of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope in Southern Africa. <br/>
									My PhD research involves investigating image-based data mining methods to analyse how lung tumours change during treatment. 
									The aim is to distinguish between elastic and inelastic tumour changes. This information can be used to personalise treatment through
									the adaptation of radiotherapy. Personalised treatment will enable the delivery of better-targeted radiotherapy and reduce
									toxicity to surrounding tissue. </br>
									<b>Research interests:</b> Trustworthy artificial intelligence, data science and health care.									  
								</p>
								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>
									I was born in the small village of Ehenye village on the outskirts of Oshakati, Namibia. Like many of my peers in northern Namibia, 
									I grew up looking after my father' goats and cattle and performing other duties traditionally performed by boys. 
									I completed my primary school at Ehenye Primary School. Attended secondary school at St. Joseph’s RC High School, 
									a boarding school 787 km from home. Dobra was a great school, and it was during my time at Dobra that I experienced 
									the diversity of Namibia for the first time. All Namibian ethnic groups were represented at Dobra and this was manifested in the languages spoken.
									St Joseph’s RC High School Dobra will always have a special place in my heart.
								</p>
								<p>
									As an undergraduate at the Polytechnic of Namibia, now Namibia University of Science & Technology (NUST) in the 2010s,
									I majored in Software Engineering. Since this was during the smartphone boom, I became interested in mobile application development.
									Pursuing this interest, I took up courses on Android mobile application development and became one of the founding members of 
									the Namibia Business Innovation Centre (now Namibia Business Innovation Institute) developers circle.  After my undergraduate, 
									I enrolled for my honour’s degree and then master’s degree in Computer Science at NUST.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2014, together with Desiree Cupido, Heinrich Aluvilu and Emilia Shikenga we became Co-leads of the <a href="https://gdg.community.dev/" target="_blank">Google Developer Group (DGD) Windhoek</a>,
									taking over from Prof Kasper Jensen. In 2017, together with Heinrich Aluvilu, Emilia Shikenga, Annastacia Shipepe and Gabriel Nhinda, 
									we established the local <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/" target="_blank">Developers Circle from Facebook (DevC Windhoek)</a>. I have been a co-lead of both communities until 2019.
								</p>
								<p>
									I enjoy running, football,  cycling, travelling, and cooking and sharing good food with friends.
